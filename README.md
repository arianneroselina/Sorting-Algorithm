# Sorting Algorithm

The main goal is to visualize many types of Sorting Algorithms in a way, that people who don't understand or even know these algorithms, can see the visualization and understand better.

### Bugs

Unfortunately, I still haven't figured out why the steps won't be shown, when the sorting process is running and because that is the point of this repo, I do hope I can fix it as soon as possible. For now it may serve as a sample code for some Sorting Algorithms. Anyone may copy and use it for their use (personal or business).
